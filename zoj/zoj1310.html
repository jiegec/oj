            The Robot Moving Institute is using a robot in their local store to transport 
different items. Of course the robot should spend only the minimum time necessary 
when travelling from one place in the store to another. The robot can move only 
along a straight line (track). All tracks form a rectangular grid. Neighbouring 
tracks are one meter apart. The store is a rectangle N x M meters and it is entirely 
covered by this grid. The distance of the track closest to the side of the store 
is exactly one meter. The robot has a circular shape with diameter equal to 1.6 
meter. The track goes through the center of the robot. The robot always faces 
north, south, west or east. The tracks are in the south-north and in the west-east 
directions. The robot can move only in the direction it faces. The direction in 
which it faces can be changed at each track crossing. Initially the robot stands 
at a track crossing. The obstacles in the store are formed from pieces occupying 
1m x 1m on the ground. Each obstacle is within a 1 x 1 square formed by the tracks. 
The movement of the robot is controlled by two commands. These commands are GO 
and TURN. 
<p> The GO command has one integer parameter n in {1,2,3}. After receiving this 
  command the robot moves n meters in the direction it faces. </p>
<p> The TURN command has one parameter which is either left or right. After receiving 
  this command the robot changes its orientation by 90<sup>o</sup> in the direction indicated 
  by the parameter. </p>
<p> The execution of each command lasts one second. </p>
<p>Help researchers of RMI to write a program which will determine the minimal 
  time in which the robot can move from a given starting point to a given destination. 
</p>
<p><br>
  <b>Input</b><br>
  <br>
  The input consists of blocks of lines. The first line of each block contains 
  two integers M &lt;= 50 and N &lt;= 50 separated by one space. In each of the 
  next M lines there are N numbers one or zero separated by one space. One represents 
  obstacles and zero represents empty squares. (The tracks are between the squares.) 
  The block is terminated by a line containing four positive integers B1 B2 E1 
  E2 each followed by one space and the word indicating the orientation of the 
  robot at the starting point. B1, B2 are the coordinates of the square in the 
  north-west corner of which the robot is placed (starting point). E1, E2 are 
  the coordinates of square to the north-west corner of which the robot should 
  move (destination point). The orientation of the robot when it has reached the 
  destination point is not prescribed. We use (row, column)-type coordinates, 
  i.e. the coordinates of the upper left (the most north-west) square in the store 
  are 0,0 and the lower right (the most south-east) square are M - 1, N - 1. The 
  orientation is given by the words north or west or south or east. The last block 
  contains only one line with N = 0 and M = 0. </p>
<p><br>
  <b>Output</b><br>
  <br>
  The output contains one line for each block except the last block in the input. 
  The lines are in the order corresponding to the blocks in the input. The line 
  contains minimal number of seconds in which the robot can reach the destination 
  point from the starting point. If there does not exist any path from the starting 
  point to the destination point the line will contain -1. </p>
